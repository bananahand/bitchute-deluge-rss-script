# bitchute-deluge-rss-script
A small bash script that will pull the rss feed for a bitchute channel, generate magnet links for all of the videos in the feed and then add them to deluge for seeding.

The script should be configured as a cronjob to automatically pull and seed new videos.

Really no point to this until webtorrent is supported by deluge though.
